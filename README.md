spring-mvc-rest
===============

This is a sample Spring MVC project using REST and JSON.

On the server-side, I will provide the following REST Service Endpoints:

URI              Method       Operation

/properties      GET          Get a list of all Properties

/properties/:id  GET          Get the Property with id of :id

/properties      POST         Add a new Property and return the Property with an id attribute added

/properties/:id  PUT          Update the Property with id of :id

/properties/:id  DELETE       Delete the Property with id of :id
